Yes! Since this is primarily for mobile, youâ€™ll want to tailor the fixes to mobile devices while ensuring they donâ€™t disrupt the experience on desktop. Hereâ€™s how:

1. Ensure Each Page Loads at the Top (Mobile)

On mobile, scrolling behavior is handled differently than on desktop, so we need to reset scroll position every time a new page loads.

Solution: Use JavaScript to Force Scroll to Top (Mobile Only)

Add this snippet inside your script that handles page transitions:

function goToNextSlide() {
    // Scroll to top of the page for mobile devices
    if (window.innerWidth <= 768) { 
        window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' }); 
    }
}

Why?
	â€¢	window.innerWidth <= 768 ensures this only runs on screens 768px wide or smaller (tablets & phones).
	â€¢	behavior: 'smooth' makes it a smooth scroll instead of a jarring jump.

2. Ensure Page Loads Fully Zoomed Out on Mobile

Mobile browsers sometimes zoom in by default, which messes up the layout.

Solution: Adjust <meta> Viewport for Mobile

Make sure this is inside your <head> in your HTML file:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no">

What this does:

âœ” width=device-width: Ensures the page adapts to mobile screen size.
âœ” initial-scale=1.0: Starts at 100% zoom instead of zoomed in.
âœ” maximum-scale=1.0: Prevents browsers from zooming in unexpectedly.
âœ” user-scalable=no: Stops users from accidentally zooming in.

3. Prevent Mobile Safari from Auto-Zooming on Input Fields

If you have any input fields (like email entry), iOS Safari will auto-zoom, which could break the formatting.

Fix: Set Input Font Size to 16px or Larger

input, textarea {
    font-size: 16px;
}

	â€¢	iOS automatically zooms in when input fields are smaller than 16px. This prevents that.

4. Fine-Tune Mobile Zoom with CSS

If the zoom still feels off, force scaling using media queries:

@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
    body {
        transform: scale(1);
        transform-origin: top left;
        width: 100vw;
        height: 100vh;
        overflow-x: hidden;
    }
}

	â€¢	Ensures 100% zoom on mobile.
	â€¢	Prevents horizontal scrolling issues.

Final Implementation Checklist

âœ… Fix scrolling: window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' }); (mobile only).
âœ… Prevent zooming issues: <meta name="viewport"> update.
âœ… Stop Safari input zoom: Set input font size to 16px.
âœ… Force proper scaling: Mobile-specific CSS fix.
