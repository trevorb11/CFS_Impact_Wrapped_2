Introduction 

 

Purpose of the Almanac 

 

The Community Food Share Impact Almanac: Fiscal Year 2025 serves as a comprehensive reference tool designed to support our internal teams. This document provides detailed insights into our programs, impact, and operations over the past year. Its purpose is to ensure that consistent language and statistics are shared about our work. While much of the content contained here will be shared publicly, the Almanac is an internal document created solely for use by Community Food Share’s staff members and board of directors. It should never be distributed (especially electronically) to someone outside of our organization. 

The Almanac consolidates key data on food distribution, volunteer contributions, financial resources, and program performance, making it easier to track our progress in the fight against hunger in Boulder and Broomfield Counties. The Almanac aims to provide: 

 

Clear and accessible data to assist with grant applications, donor communications, and program evaluation. 

Program-specific information to ensure that our partners and teams have the data they need to share our success stories and measure impact. 

Comprehensive historical and current insights into hunger and food security in our service area, helping to contextualize our work and advocate for continued support. 

A transparent view into how our resources are utilized to address food insecurity and enhance community well-being. 

 

The Almanac is structured to be an easy-to-navigate resource for anyone seeking specific program information, financial figures, or facts about hunger in the communities we serve. It reflects our commitment to transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement in our mission to alleviate hunger and support local food security. 

Data in the Almanac is updated and distributed every September. The process is facilitated by the marketing department, but many staff members are involved in the execution.

Brief History of Community Food Share 

 

Community Food Share was established in 1981 as a response to the growing issue of hunger in Boulder County, with key local organizations, including Boulder County Safehouse and Emergency Family Assistance Association, recognizing the need for a dedicated food bank. Initially supported by a seed grant from Foothills United Way, Community Food Share quickly became an affiliate of America’s Second Harvest (now Feeding America) and began distributing food to 18 agencies from a modest space in Boulder. 

From distributing 48,000 pounds of food in its first year, Community Food Share has grown exponentially, now serving Boulder and Broomfield Counties. Milestones include the introduction of key programs like Elder Share (1988) and Feeding Families (2004), the launch of its first Mobile Pantry (2002), and a move to a larger 70,000 square foot facility in Louisville (2013). In recent years, Community Food Share has responded to major crises such as the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and the 2021 Marshall Fire, setting records for food distribution and adapting to meet the increasing need in the community. 

Today, Community Food Share continues to innovate, launching initiatives like the Service Insights on Meal Connect (SIMC) in 2023 to better understand and meet the needs of its neighbors.

Overview of the Food Bank’s Mission and Programs 

 

At Community Food Share, our mission is to eliminate hunger in Boulder and Broomfield Counties through engagement, collaboration, and leadership. We are committed to providing access to nutritious food for individuals and families in need, while promoting long-term solutions to hunger in our community. 

Our programs are designed to meet the diverse needs of those we serve, from our Feeding Families Program, which provides households with weekly free groceries,  to Blue Spruce Neighbors, delivering groceries and prepared meals to homebound seniors. Through our Mobile Pantries, we reach underserved communities by bringing food directly to those who face barriers to access. Additionally, we collaborate with over 40 partner agencies to ensure that food is distributed efficiently across the region. 

These programs are supported by the dedication of volunteers, food donors, and community partners who share our vision of a hunger-free future. 

 

Impact at a Glance 

 

We distribute over 30,000 meals each day through our network of 42 Partner Agencies, as well as our onsite and mobile pantries, enough to provide three meals to everyone in a sold-out Red Rocks Amphitheater. 

 

Last year, Community Food Share distributed 13 million pounds of food, equivalent to 11 million meals. 

 

72% of this distribution consisted of fresh produce, dairy, and high-protein foods, supporting healthy and balanced diets. 

 

We provided 7.46 million meals to our network of 42 Partner Agencies, valued at $17.63 million.  

 

Our direct distribution programs served nearly 18,000 individuals across Boulder and Broomfield Counties, representing a 72% increase from 2023. 

 

Combined with our partner agencies, we estimate serving more than 60,000 individuals in Boulder and Broomfield Counties this year. 

 

Community Food Share distributes enough food for nearly 30,000 meals each day. 

Since our founding in 1981, we have distributed over 217 million meals. 

 

2,357 volunteers support our operations annually, contributing time equivalent to 13 full-time employees. 

 

Volunteers contribute 25% of all hours worked at Community Food Share, saving the organization $969,250 in labor costs. 

 

Community Food Share rescues 11 tons of food each day that would otherwise go to waste, that’s the equivalent weight of 112 baby elephants, 11 bison, or 5 and a half cars! 

 

85% of the food distributed by Community Food Share is generously donated. 

 

Our food rescue efforts prevent over 9,000 tons of CO2 emissions annually, equivalent to removing 2,200 cars from the road for a year. 

 

Food rescue at Community Food Share also saves 410 million gallons of water each year, which is enough to fill 622 Olympic-sized swimming pools. 

 

During our operating hours, we ship out 105 lbs. of food per minute.  

 

FY 2024 Overview 

Hunger and Food Security in our Service Area 

 

Hunger remains a significant challenge in Boulder and Broomfield Counties, impacting thousands of individuals and families. 1 in 10 people in the region—41,320 individuals, representing 10.3% of the total population—struggle with food insecurity, lacking consistent access to enough nutritious food to lead active, healthy lives. This burden is particularly heavy on children, with 7,010 children (9.3%) in the two-county area facing food insecurity, or 1 in 12 children. 

Child food insecurity continues to be a pressing concern. In the 2022-2023 school year, 19,500 students across Boulder and Broomfield Counties qualified for free or reduced-price lunches. Among these, 2,563 students in Boulder County attend high-poverty schools where over 75% of students rely on these meal programs. With the introduction of Colorado’s Healthy School Meals for All program in the 2023-2024 school year, public School Food Authorities, including St. Vrain Valley School District and Boulder Valley School District, have ensured that all students receive free meals. 

For many families, the rising cost of living exacerbates their food insecurity. In Boulder and Broomfield Counties, according to the Self-Sufficiency Standard, a family of four needs to earn an annual income of at least $100,000 to cover basic needs without public or private assistance, more than 350% more than the federal poverty level and 400% more than a person makes working at minimum wage. Yet, the majority of families served by Community Food Share and its partners earn $55,500 or less annually, well below the threshold required to make ends meet. 

Additionally, the high cost of food in the region deepens the strain. The average meal in Boulder and Broomfield Counties costs $4.83, which is 20% higher than the national average. On a monthly basis, individuals in the region spend an average of $435 per person on food, placing a significant financial burden on those already struggling to meet basic needs. 

 

Food Distribution Breakdown (FY24 and FY25 Projections) 

In FY25, Community Food Share anticipates distributing 12 million pounds of food to meet the growing needs of Boulder and Broomfield Counties. This target is not a fixed goal but an estimate based on community demand. Of this distribution, at least 70% will consist of fresh, nutritious items, including: 

30% fresh produce 

25% dairy products 

15% high-protein foods such as meat and peanut butter. 

FY24 Food Distribution Overview 

In FY24, Community Food Share exceeded its expectations, distributing 13.1 million pounds of food, surpassing the projected 11 million pounds. A significant portion of this distribution—72%—consisted of fresh produce, dairy, and high-protein items, providing essential nutrition to the community. We estimate that the food was distributed across our network to feed 88,000 unduplicated individuals.

Food Distribution by Program 

Partner Agency Distribution 

Community Food Share works in collaboration with 42 nonprofit organizations, known as Partner Agencies, to distribute groceries and meals throughout Boulder and Broomfield Counties. These agencies play a critical role in extending our reach to ensure that nutritious food is accessible to individuals and families in need across the community. More details about individual Partner Agencies is available in Appendix C.  

In FY24, our Partner Agencies were responsible for distributing 68% of the total food provided by Community Food Share, which equated to approximately 9 million pounds of food. This distribution helped provide an estimated 7.5 million meals, with a monetary value of $17.6 million. Partner Agencies purchase food and secure food donations from sources beyond Community Food Share; their additional sourcing efforts add 4.3 million pounds to the charitable food system for Boulder and Broomfield Counties. 

Food distributed to Partner Agencies in FY24 included: 

31.10% Fresh Produce 

23.53% Dairy 

17.07% Protein 

26.44% Other Foods 

1.87% Non-foods 

Partner Agencies collectively handled 301,000 food pantry visits, ensuring that families had regular access to food. In addition to groceries, Partner Agencies also provided 670,000 meals and snacks directly to individuals in need, further supporting the community. 

By working closely with these Partner Agencies, Community Food Share is able to maximize the impact of our food distribution efforts and ensure that resources are reaching the people who need them most. For a complete list of our Partner Agencies, please visit our website. 

Direct Distribution Programs 

Community Food Share operates three key Direct Distribution Programs that serve residents across Boulder and Broomfield Counties. These programs play a vital role in ensuring food access for families and individuals facing food insecurity, reaching communities directly with fresh and nutritious food: 

Feeding Families 

Mobile Pantries 

Blue Spruce Neighbors 

 

 

In FY24, these programs accounted for 4.2 million pounds of food distributed, which represents 32% of our total food distribution. This marks an 11% increase in pounds distributed compared to FY23. Food distributed by Direct Distribution, including flex distributions, in FY24 included: 

33.66% Fresh Produce 

17.73% Dairy 

21.03% Protein 

18.16% Other Foods 

9.43% Non-foods (Colorado Pet Pantry deliveries) 

Across the board, our direct distribution programs saw record growth in every category, as we continued to expand our impact on local communities.

These programs provide critical food assistance, delivering nutritious meals to families, seniors, and individuals, and contributing to substantial cost savings for those in need. 

Feeding Families Pantry 

Feeding Families is a critical direct distribution program operated by Community Food Share, serving individuals and families in Boulder and Broomfield Counties. The program is open to anyone in need, with no income or eligibility requirements, allowing those facing food insecurity to access a wide variety of healthy food options at our choice pantry, located at the Community Food Share warehouse. Shoppers are welcome to visit once a week and can also access government support through the TEFAP program. Additionally, through our partnership with WeeCycle, we provided over 30,000 diapers for 596 families with babies and toddlers. 

In FY24, Feeding Families distributed over 2.8 million pounds of food across more than 40,000 visits, serving nearly 12,000 unduplicated individuals (53% increase over fy23), including over 4,000 children (54% more children than FY23). Feeding Families enrolled an average of 137 new households and 409 new Neighbors each month. The pantry operates 156 days per year, three days a week, with extended hours designed to accommodate those with traditional work schedules. It is open on Wednesdays and Fridays from 9 AM to 3 PM, and on Thursdays from 12 PM to 6 PM. 

Food distributed by Feeding Families in FY24 included: 

37.24% Fresh Produce 

15.55% Dairy 

22.78% Protein 

21.29% Other Foods 

3.14% Non-foods 

To improve the shopping experience and reduce wait times, Community Food Share introduced a reservation system in FY24, known as the Waitwell system. This change received overwhelmingly positive feedback from Neighbors, as it allowed for a more streamlined and stress-free shopping process. According to the Neighbor Feedback Report, 97% of shoppers reported feeling treated with dignity and respect, and the majority expressed satisfaction with the variety and quality of food provided. 

Feeding Families remains a vital part of our mission, ensuring that everyone, regardless of their circumstances, has access to nutritious groceries in a welcoming and dignified environment. 

Blue Spruce Neighbors 

Blue Spruce Neighbors, previously known as Elder Share, is Community Food Share’s dedicated program aimed at supporting low-income seniors in Boulder and Broomfield Counties. The program plays a crucial role in addressing food insecurity for seniors who may face barriers such as limited mobility, transportation challenges, or health issues that make traditional food assistance difficult to access. 

In FY24, the program served 846 unique seniors through 10,005 home deliveries and on-site distributions at senior housing communities. Each participant received approximately 50 pounds of food per month, including prepared meals, fresh produce, dairy, and protein-rich items, ensuring balanced and nutritious meals. Blue Spruce enrolled an average of 21 new households and 31 new Neighbors per month in FY24. Blue Spruce Neighbors operates primarily through direct deliveries to senior housing sites and offers an in-building choice pantry for those unable to attend distributions, making nutritious food accessible in a dignified and community-centered way. 

This program remains a vital lifeline for older adults, fostering a sense of connection and well-being by ensuring consistent access to healthy food. In FY24 Distributions occurred at the following sites:  

YMCA Longmont 

Golden West Towers Senior Living (Boulder) 

Lodge Senior Living (Longmont) 

Hearthstone Senior Living (Longmont) 

Mountain View Plaza Senior Living (Longmont) 

Spring Creek Senior Living (Longmont)  

Fall River Senior Living (Longmont) 

Aspen Meadows (Longmont) 

Blue Spruce also delivers food boxes biweekly to homebound seniors in the following areas: 

Louisville 

Lafayette 

Boulder (Nest Deliveries) 

Broomfield 

Food distributed by Blue Spruce in FY24 included: 

33.40% Fresh Produce 

27.40% Dairy 

23.96% Protein 

15.21% Other Foods 

0.02% Non-foods 

 

In FY24 interviews and feedback sessions were conducted with program participants to better understand their needs and preferences. These interviews revealed high satisfaction with the food quality and delivery process but also identified a desire for more variety and flexibility in distribution times. This feedback has been instrumental in guiding future improvements to the program, ensuring it continues to meet the evolving needs of our senior Neighbors. 

Mobile Pantry Program 

The Mobile Pantry Program is a cornerstone of Community Food Share's efforts to reach underserved communities across Boulder and Broomfield Counties. Launched in 2002, the program has grown from a single pilot site to a network of permanent and pop-up locations, ensuring that food reaches individuals and families facing barriers to traditional food access. 

In FY24, the Mobile Pantry distributed nearly 700,000 pounds of food, serving over 5,000 individuals across multiple locations. Mobile Pantries enrolled an average of 117 new households, and 382 new neighbors per month in FY24. The number of children served by Mobile Pantries increased 149% from FY23 to FY24.  While participation rates have been higher than ever, the integration of an improved data tracking system, SIMC, at mobile pantries is attributed with some of the large spike in attendance. We are unable to determine how much of the growth is attributed to improved metrics and how much is attributed to program growth.  

Mobile pantries operate in a mix of walk-up and drive-up styles, giving Neighbors the flexibility to receive groceries in a way that works for them. 

Key Locations: 

Westview Presbyterian Church (Longmont): Operating on the 1st and 3rd Tuesdays and Thursdays of the month in FY24. In FY25 the Tuesday distribution was eliminated.  

Countryside Village (Longmont): Operating on the 2nd and 4th Thursdays of the month. 

Centennial Elementary School (Longmont): Operating on the 2nd and 4th Wednesdays of the month. In FY25 this distribution was moved to Broomfield Sports Complex.  

Nest Apartments (Boulder): Operating on the 1st and 3rd Wednesdays of the month. 

In FY24, listening sessions and surveys were conducted to gather feedback from Neighbors, revealing high levels of satisfaction with the services but also identifying areas for improvement, such as reducing wait times and increasing the variety of available food. 

Food distributed at Mobile Pantries in FY24 included: 

33.98% Fresh Produce 

30.32% Dairy 

21.50% Protein 

13.73% Other Foods 

0.47% Non-foods 

The Mobile Pantry continues to be a critical resource for the community, ensuring that those facing transportation or other barriers still have access to nutritious food. 

Flexible Distributions 

As part of our Direct Distribution Programs, Community Food Share offers Flexible Distributions, which allow us to serve our neighbors through "pop-up" pantries and food drops that don’t require ongoing staff involvement for distribution. These flexible solutions help meet immediate needs in specific communities and reach underserved populations more efficiently. 

In FY24, Community Food Share coordinated several flexible distributions across Boulder and Broomfield Counties, providing significant amounts of food, over 292,000 lbs, to local organizations and communities: 

Boulder County Probation Office: 2,700 pounds 

Colorado Pet Pantry: 297,000 pounds 

Conscious Alliance: 1,200 pounds 

Crestview Elementary: 7,600 pounds 

Lafayette Gardens Mobile Home Park: 42,000 pounds 

These distributions enable us to expand our impact and respond to unique community needs in a timely and flexible manner, ensuring that food reaches those who need it most without the logistical challenges of traditional distribution models.

Volunteer Program 

Volunteers continue to be the backbone of Community Food Share's operations, making a significant impact on our ability to serve the community. In FY24, we saw an impressive commitment from 2,357 unduplicated volunteers, marking a 1% increase compared to FY23. These dedicated individuals contributed a total of 26,567 hours, representing a 10% increase in hours donated over the previous year. 

Volunteers account for 25% of all hours worked at Community Food Share, which is the equivalent of having an additional 13 full-time employees. This contribution of time and effort is invaluable, with the estimated value of the time donated amounting to nearly $970,000. 

Every hour of time donated by volunteers provides 55 meals.  

The dedication of our volunteers allows us to maximize resources and extend our reach in the fight against hunger in Boulder and Broomfield Counties, ensuring that food reaches those who need it most.

FY 2024 Net Distribution = 13,142,265 pounds 

Operating Hours: 8 hours/day 

260 weekdays in the year  

260 days x 8 hours x 60 minutes = 124,800 minutes/year  

13,142,265 / 124,800 minutes = 105.31 pounds/minute  

Meals Per Day

Food Waste Equivalents 

Community Food Share rescues 11 tons of food a day that would otherwise go to waste — that’s equivalent in weight to 112 baby elephants!  

5,839,958 lbs. of rescued food / 2000 = 2,919 tons of rescue food 

Actual pounds per day (assuming 260 workdays): 2861 tons / 260 days =  11.23 tons per day or 22,461 lbs. per day 

Baby elephants weigh 200 lbs. = 112 baby elephants 

Cars weigh 4000 lbs. = 5.6 cars 

Bison weigh 2,000 lbs. = 11.2 bison 

Value of Community Roots Produce	 

Value based on average weight of a CSA box being 10 lbs. Average price of a CSA box in Boulder County in FY24 is $36.00.  

Volunteer calculations 

In 2024 volunteer time is valued at $36.36 in the state of Colorado.  

Volunteers support is equivalent to 13 full time employees.  

26,657 volunteer hours / 2,080 hours per full time employee = 12.382 

Volunteers account for 25% of all hours worked at CFS 

83,768 employee hours + 26567 volunteer hours = 110,425 hours 

26,567/110,425 = 24.14% 

Total number served across network service area 

Estimates of people served through network: 301,806 (A 7% increase YoY) reported pantry visits by partner agencies. The average number of visits per household in SIMC network + Feeding Families (In FY24 this network includes Lyons, Round Pantry, Elder Share and Mobile Pantry.) is approximately 5 times over the course of a year. We assume half of people in our direct distribution programs use another agency in addition to our programs, a close approximate based on best available data.   

 

301,806 visits/5 visits per household * average household size of 2.9 individuals per household =  unique individuals 175,047 * 50% is 87,523 unique individuals. This is a conservative estimate considering we are only counting pantry visits, not meal support services.  

Employee Time 

Total hours paid for all employees includes PTO, OT, holiday pay 

Donation Equivalencies 

The cost of providing 1 meal is $0.66/meal based on 3-year rolling average of cost/meal. This figure is only used for converting fund raising dollars. It is not accurate for anything else.  

 

Average cost of groceries is $101.43/ week (average cost of meal *21) 

If 1.2 pounds equals one meal and there are 21 meals in a week. Total pounds of food per week=1.2×21=25.2 pounds 

Total cost of groceries per week: $101.43 

Retail Cost per pound: 

Divide the total weekly grocery cost by the total pounds of food: Cost per pound=101.43/ 25.2 = $4.03 

Therefore, the retail cost of 1 pound of food is approximately $4.03. 

According to Feeding America, $1 helps provide 9 lbs of produce secured by Feeding America on behalf of member food banks.  

 

Mobile Pantry: 678689 lbs/ 5749 individuals = 118 lbs per person/ year 

118 lbs per person / 12 moths = 9.8 lbs per person/ month 

9.8 lbs per person/ 1.2 lbs per meal = 8.19 meals per person 

2.73 people per household* 8.19 meals per person = 22.38 meals per household per month 

22.38 meals per household * .66/meal = $15.06 /household/month 

 

Feeding Families: 2,842,946  lbs/ 11,918 individuals = 238.5 lbs/ household/ year 

238.5 lbs/ year / 12 months = 19 lbs per person per month/ 1.2 meals = 16.56 meals / person / month 

16.56 meals / person * 3.199 people per household = 52.99 meals / household / month 

52.99 meals * .66/ meal =$ 34.97 for one month of household food in ff  

 

Blue Spruce Neighbors: 311,785 lbs/ 846 individuals = 368.54 lbs/person/month 

368.54/1.2meals/lb = 307 meals / year/ person/ 12 =25.59 meals per person per month

Appendix C: Full History of Community Food Share 

Introduction 

In the early 1980s, hunger had not yet been widely recognized as a community problem in Boulder County. However, when organizations such as Boulder County Safehouse, the Community Action Program, Emergency Family Assistance Association (EFAA), St. Thomas Aquinas Food Bank, and the Salvation Army of Longmont came together to share their observations and data, it became clear that hunger was a pressing issue in the community. These discussions led to the realization that a food bank, modeled after Food Bank of the Rockies, was needed to address the growing problem of food insecurity locally. 

In 1981, Community Food Share was established as a nonprofit organization with a seed grant from what is now Foothills United Way. The organization also became an affiliate of America’s Second Harvest (now Feeding America). Initially, Community Food Share operated under the umbrella of Food Bank of the Rockies, with operations run out of a small space at EFAA’s ECHO House Emergency Shelter. At that time, Kathy Coyne was hired as the sole staff member, and the organization immediately began collecting and distributing food to 18 human service agencies in Boulder County. 

Early Growth and Community Engagement 

Shortly after its founding, the City of Boulder provided Community Food Share with a space in a city-owned building on 13th Street for a nominal rent of $1 per year. With a more stable operating base, the food bank increased its efforts to raise awareness about hunger. Kathy Coyne took on the role of advocating for the cause, speaking to civic organizations and community members, working tirelessly to engage the public and build support for the mission. By the end of its first year, Community Food Share had distributed 48,000 pounds of food—a remarkable achievement that signaled its importance to the community. 

At the time, food banks were still a relatively new concept in the United States, with most located in larger metropolitan areas. Community Food Share, being smaller, had the flexibility to innovate and create new programs that directly addressed the local hunger problem. This spirit of innovation, combined with the dedication of loyal volunteers, financial supporters, and food donors, has carried Community Food Share through decades of growth and success. 

Key Milestones and Expansion 

1981: Community Food Share is founded as a nonprofit organization and becomes a member of America’s Second Harvest (now Feeding America). Operations begin in a small space loaned by EFAA’s Echo House Emergency Shelter. 

1982: The food bank moves to city-owned space on 13th Street in Boulder. The organization adds the TEFAP (Emergency Food Assistance Program) and the Gleaning Program to its operations. 

1985: The Daily Camera “Let’s Bag Hunger” Food Drive begins, further raising awareness and community involvement. 

1987: Community Food Share relocates to Flatirons Park and purchases its first freezer and coolers, enabling it to store and distribute perishable foods. 

1988: The Elder Share Program is launched, providing groceries to low-income seniors, which continues to be a cornerstone of Community Food Share’s services. 

1998: The organization moves into a new 22,400-square-foot facility near Niwot, expanding its capacity for food storage and distribution. 

2002: The first mobile pantry is introduced, bringing food assistance directly to underserved areas. 

2004: The Feeding Families Program begins, focusing on supporting low-income families with children. 

2013: Community Food Share moves to its current location, a renovated 70,000-square-foot facility in the Colorado Technology Center in Louisville. This move proved invaluable during the flood of September 2013, as the extra space allowed the organization to handle a significant surge in food distribution for flood relief efforts. 

2015: CEO Jim Baldwin retires, and Michelle Orge is hired as the new Executive Director. The Board of Directors refines the organization’s mission statement: "To be a leader in our community’s effort to end hunger in Boulder and Broomfield Counties." The repack room is built, enabling more efficient bulk food purchasing and repackaging. 

2016: The first Needs Assessment is completed in collaboration with local partners, identifying geographic areas of unmet need and revealing barriers to accessing services. The innovative Produce “Push” Model is introduced, allowing partner agencies to add fresh produce to their original orders during deliveries. 

2017: Community Food Share adds a mobile pantry truck to its fleet, launches a new website with Spanish language pages, and refines its mission and vision statements: "To eliminate hunger in Boulder and Broomfield Counties through engagement, collaboration, and leadership" and "A hunger-free community." 

2018: The organization sets a record for monthly pounds distributed (986,919 pounds) and completes its first-ever strategic plan. Solar panels are added to the facility, offsetting 60% of energy use, making it one of the most solar-powered food banks in the Feeding America Network. 

2019: The Food Security Network is launched, and the Tee Up! Against Hunger Golf Tournament celebrates its 30th anniversary. Kimberly Ruotsala becomes the new Executive Director after Michelle Orge's departure. 

2020: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly increases demand for food assistance, leading to record-breaking food distributions. Community Food Share merges its TEFAP and Feeding Families programs and adjusts program eligibility and service hours to better meet community needs. 

2021: February marks an all-time 12-month record for pounds distributed (nearly 13 million), reflecting the impact of the pandemic. The King Soopers Table Mesa mass shooting leads to the donation of the store’s entire inventory to Community Food Share, the largest single food donation in its history. 

2022: Community Food Share responds to the Marshall Fire, providing food assistance to impacted families and raising nearly $400,000 for relief efforts. The organization also launches the Spring Resource Fair, offering outreach services and gardening resources to community members. 

2023: The Service Insights on Meal Connect (SIMC) platform is implemented, allowing for better data collection and analysis to improve service delivery. The organization holds a series of resource fairs and launches Listening Sessions to better understand the needs of its clients. 

2024: In FY24, Community Food Share focused on expanding the Service Insights on Meal Connect (SIMC) platform to new programs and agencies for FY25, while improving measurement through weekly customer satisfaction surveys for Feeding Families shoppers. The organization also saw increased demand at its pantry, especially from migrants, and successfully hosted its 4th Resource Fair in collaboration with Clinica Family Health, which will now be an annual event. The Collaborations team launched the Wait Well reservation and queue management software to provide better customer experience during heighted demand for pantry services.  

Looking Ahead 

In 2025 and beyond, Community Food Share continues its strategic refresh, focusing on enhancing its programs and reaching more people in need. With the ongoing support of the community, volunteers, donors, and partners, the organization remains committed to fighting hunger and building a hunger-free future for Boulder and Broomfield Counties.
