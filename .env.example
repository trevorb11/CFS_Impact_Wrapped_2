# Security configurations
# Generate a secure key with: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
# The key should be kept secret and consistent across environments for URL compatibility
VITE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_secret_key_here
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_secret_key_here  # Same as VITE_ENCRYPTION_KEY for compatibility

# Database connection (automatically provided by Replit)
# DATABASE_URL=postgres://your_database_connection_string

# Notes:
# 1. The encryption key is used to secure donor data in URLs
# 2. URLs encrypted with one key can only be decrypted with the same key
# 3. Make sure the key is available in all environments where decryption is needed
# 4. Never commit the actual .env file with real keys to version control
